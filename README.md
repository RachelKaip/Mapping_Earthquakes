# Mapping Earthquakes

In this body of work, we used Leaflet, JavaScript, HTML and CSS to map earthquakes colorfully based on their location and maginitude.  The final map has four components:

1. A map of all earthquakes
   - Earthqquakes mapped absed on location and rated colorfully on a scale of 0 to > 5 based on thier magnitude  

2. A map of only major earthquakes 
   - Earthqukes colorfully rated in three categories, maginitudes < 5, > 5, and > 6
3. A map of the world's techtonic plates

4. Three different tile layers

The various ways to view this data makes it easy to learn about earthquakes and their patterns!
